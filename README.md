INTRODUCTION 
Using the  dataset consists of a nearly 3000 Amazon customer reviews (input text), star ratings, date of review, variant and feedback of various amazon Alexa products like Alexa Echo, Echo dots, Alexa Firesticks etc. for learning how to train Machine for sentiment analysis. We trained a model to classify reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on the text content, which can help understand customer satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement. Also we  implemented  a model to predict the helpfulness of a review based on the input content. With valuable insights,  we want to providing a deeper understanding of users' emotions and sentiments towards the product. And we want to help product team better get their products upgrade from the reality.

The dataset is from Kaggle, the source is extracted from Amazon's website, with the columns of ratings, verified reviews, date and feedback. We cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using the Python nltk package to remove stop words and punctuations.
